  # The macOS builds are ad-hoc signed, not notarized, so Homebrew's
  # unconditional quarantine would make first launch fail with
  # "Apple could not verify Arroxy.app is free of malware". Homebrew
  # removed --no-quarantine in 4.7, so a tap that ships unsigned apps
  # has to strip the attribute itself; upstream tells tap maintainers
  # this post-processing is theirs to do. Drop this stanza once the
  # app is notarized.
